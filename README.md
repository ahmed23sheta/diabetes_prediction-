Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning 

Project Objectives:
The objective of this project is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain
diagnostic measurements included in the dataset

Libraries:
•Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
• NumPy for numerical computing evaluation
•Matplotlib ,seaborn for visualisation 
•sktlearn for machine learning model

steps:
1)import libraries
2)upload data &show it
3)understanding the data by some function
4) check null values and replace it by mean values
5)visualization by seaborn &matplotlib to show our data &understanding it py plot
6)find correlation between values &plot it
7)standardization data
8)train_test_split
9)training the model
10)accuracy_score
11)Making a Predictive System
